# Workers can send periodic touch messages to nsqd to say they
# are still actively processing a request. The touch request
# resets the timer for that message, so it won't time out.
# However, you can only touch the message up to max-msg-threshold
# before nsqd decides to requeue the message. Some of our very
# large files really will take this long to process!
