TestBags.zip contains bags used for integration testing. These bags should be
present in the S3 bucket called aptrust.integration.test. We keep TestBags.zip
in the git repository in case the test bags are deleted from
aptrust.integration.test. If that ever happens, just unzip the test bags and
re-upload them to S3.

These bags meet specific conditions that we want to test in our integration tests.
