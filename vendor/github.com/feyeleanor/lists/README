== About ==

Lists provide several implementations of classic linked-list data structures. Currently the following datatypes
are provided:

LinearList is a standard singly-linked list without any protections to guard against cyclic links between nodes;

CycList is a generalised circular list where the terminating node links back to the first node.

Both CycList and LinearList use a common ListHeader allowing them to be interchanged as necessary. This ListHeader
has a chain.Node type associated with it which specifies the type of node used by a given instance of a list, and
provides access caching to speed operations in frequently accessed portions of the list.
